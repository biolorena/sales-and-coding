Looks like PostHog is searching for someone who can pull a wololo (not literally, yet) and conveert engineers. Someone who knows well about that kind of conversion and survived the seven circles of outbound before could come in handy.

As one of the founding SDRs at Hotjar, I helped build the function from zero by constantly balancing “don’t break what’s working” and lots of experiments. It taught me that the best outreach feels like a coincidence (and prevents the brand from spontaneously combusting in the process).

Simon already knows part of how I've done that and apparently enjoyed our conversation, but I'd love to share with the team as well.

While we’re not talking yet, here’s mini website (you can call it some sort of "code outreach") that explains a little bit of why you could use a resourceful and experienced BDR to be your next hedgehog whisperer.
