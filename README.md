A nostalgic experiment.

Years ago I used to mess with blog templates in raw HTML and even programmed some Arduino projects for my neuroscience lab project, but I forgot almost everything.  
This was my way to relearn the basics, mix in some humor, and see what I could ship and edit quickly with some AI help.

## Why
Instead of doing yet another ‚Äúhello world,‚Äù I wanted to blend nostalgia (blog HTML, Arduino fun) with my current world of outreach as an SDR.  
So here's a playful page where you‚Äôll find two buttons (only one of them actually plays nice).

## Features
- Two buttons with very different personalities 
- A feature flag that flips on when you least expect it  
- A dash of confetti üéâ  
- Pills with a mix of my personality + outreach learnings  

## Tech
Plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Built faster thanks to **AI-assisted coding** - part experiment, part creative therapy and lots of editing.
